## Context

Sandpile is a math model designed to analyze the criticality self-organization through graph theory and cellular automaton

Given that, write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

Prototype: ```void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);```\
You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically

## Captain's log

### Manual approaching

The sum of each part of the grid is not a problem. Just left to iterate through each part of the array and do the arithmetic operation. The difficult part is with the stability and the toppling. In that case, is necessary a function that check if the resulting grid is stable or not, iterating through, and checking if each cell is not major than 3. In case that the grid is unstable, a function that process the toppling, giving one sand to each horizontal and vertical cell around (Neighbors). Then, the resulting sandpile is checked again

### Pseudo code

1. Add each cell of both grids, into a new one
2. Check if is stable (Each cell is less than 3)
3. If a cell is not stable, perform toppling (Add one to the neighbors)
4. Else, return the resulting Sandpile

### Curiousities

- This approach is complex about time execution
- One bad thing is to perform the iteration every time's one cell is not stable. If save that position, could be better
